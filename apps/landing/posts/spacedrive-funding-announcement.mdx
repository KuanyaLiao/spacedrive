> File storage is a painfully fragmented and proprietary problem area with enormous lock-in risk. Spacedrive promises to dramatically simplify and transform this market by delivering infra-neutral user freedoms and innovation levels like never before seen. OSS Capital is highly honored to lead this founding seed alongside over half a dozen phenomenal open source founders and builders who have gone from zero to many billion + outcomes!

I'm fascinated with data storage. I have preserved my life and creative work since I was a small child. Capturing tens of thousands of memories, keeping project files and leaving a disorganized trail of screenshots, recordings, and memes, behind me for nearly two decades.

My dream has long been to organize it all. But no single cloud service or app has ever met all my needs, and it led to the realization that today's data infrastructure is almost entirely dependent on the cloud. Not everything belongs in the cloud (or one particular cloud). Some files are just too big or too sensitive, and sometimes we even forget which cloud, hard drive, or device, has a file we need.

54.62% of people use at least 3 different cloud services, and more than half are deeply concerned about data loss and privacy [(according to a 2021 study conducted by GoodFirms Research.)](https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/personal-cloud-storage-trends#:~:text=92.13%25%20of%20people%20think%20cloud,sync%20systems%20over%20a%20period.)

We could fix this all with a shift in architecture. I thought, "what if we took the best tools from the cloud and put them on your devices... and made it open source?" Cloud service providers could become just storage silos, and you'd remain the central source of truth for your data.

I pictured an app shaped like a file explorer but packed with tech you've never seen in one before. **I called it Spacedrive**.

Imagine if all your files could be managed virtually: your laptop, smartphone, external drives, and cloud accounts, all pooled together as a single filesystem. Spacedrive accomplishes this using a decentralized database that securely synchronizes folder structures/file metadata between devices in realtime. It uses *content addressable storage* to identify files via their "fingerprint" so that duplicates can be tracked/managed, even with folders from several storage locations.

With Spacedrive you'd be able to create photo albums spanning multiple OSes/clouds, automate your data routines, and search your offline devices or drives, all with redundancy to prevent data loss. You'd have automatically cached access to compressed thumbnails and preview media across all your content. The possibilities are vast.

Spacedrive functions as a decentralized system, with each device acting as a node of your personal file management network. Our business model will provide a cloud instance of Spacedrive that would function as an additional node. *This would be an optional service* that would add encrypted database backups, simple file sharing, public hosted libraries, and more.

No core features will be restricted behind a paywall and our architecture deliberately prioritizes data privacy, ownership, and freedom.

Before I open sourced the repo on GitHub last month, I didn't think that repositories could just go viral on their own. But it turns out the concept struck a chord with a lot of people and Spacedrive became the #1 trending repo worldwide for three days, swiftly surpassing 10k stars. It reached the front page of Hacker News, not once, but twice (maybe a little prematurely).

With Joseph Jacks from OSS Capital leading our $2m funding round, we have an incredible array of angel investors participating as well. AngelList Co-Founder Naval Ravikant, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, Shopify CEO Tobias L√ºtke, GitHub Co-Founder Tom Preston-Werner, Co-Creator of Apache Kafka Neha Narkhede, Head of Edge Infrastructure at Equinix Zachary Smith, CEO of Alluxio Haoyuan Li (who wrote the paper on the Virtual Distributed File System in which Spacedrive is loosely based), BloomTech CEO Austen Allred, former VP of Sales at Elasticsearch Justin Hoffman, former VMware COO Sanjay Poonen, Cal.com CEO Peer Richelsen and more.

With some of the greatest minds in technology backing us, and a large community passionate for our vision, we're positioned to make a sizable impact on the way we handle our most valuable personal data.

Follow @spacedriveapp on Twitter for updates and join the waitlist to be one of the first to try the beta. We're also hiring, 3 full-time remote positions available with equity offerings.
