> File storage is a painfully fragmented and proprietary problem area with enormous lock-in risk. Spacedrive promises to dramatically simplify and transform this market by delivering infra-neutral user freedoms and innovation levels like never before seen. OSS Capital is highly honored to lead this founding seed alongside over half a dozen phenomenal open source founders and builders who have gone from zero to many billion + outcomes!

I'm fascinated with data storage. I have preserved my life and creative work since I was a small child. Capturing tens of thousands of memories, keeping project files and leaving a disorganized trail of screenshots, recordings, and memes, behind me for nearly two decades.

My dream has long been to organize it all. But no single cloud service or app has ever met all my needs, and it led to the realization that today's data infrastructure is almost entirely dependent on the cloud. Not everything belongs in the cloud (or one particular cloud). Some files are just too big or too sensitive, and sometimes we even forget which cloud, hard drive, or device, has a file we need.

54.62% of people use at least 3 different cloud services, and more than half are deeply concerned about data loss and privacy [(according to a 2021 study conducted by GoodFirms Research.)](https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/personal-cloud-storage-trends#:~:text=92.13%25%20of%20people%20think%20cloud,sync%20systems%20over%20a%20period.)

We could fix this all with a shift in architecture. I thought, "what if we took the best tools from the cloud and put them on your devices... and made it open source?" Cloud service providers could become just storage silos, and you'd remain the central source of truth for your data.

I pictured an app shaped like a file explorer but packed with tech you've never seen in one before. **I called it Spacedrive**.

Imagine if all your file management happened virtually ‚Äî laptop, smartphone, external drives, and cloud accounts, could all pool together to form a single filesystem. Spacedrive accomplishes this using a decentralized database that securely synchronizes folder structures/file metadata between devices in realtime. It uses *content addressable storage* to identify files via their "fingerprint" so that duplicates can be tracked/managed, even with folders from several storage locations.

With redundancy to prevent any loss of data, you'd be able to create photo albums that are OS/cloud agnostic, automate data routines, and search your offline devices/drives. You could even generate highly compressed thumbnails and preview media automatically. The possibilities are vast.

Spacedrive is decentralized, each device is a node in your personal network. Our business will provide the software as an optional service. A cloud instance of Spacedrive is just another node. It will provide encrypted database backup, simple file sharing, public hosted libraries and more. No core features will be restricted behind a paywall and our architecture deliberately prioritizes privacy, ownership and freedom.

Last month I open sourced the repo on GitHub, I was not previously aware repositories could go viral on their own, until mine did. Spacedrive sat at #1 on trending worldwide for three days, swiftly surpassing 10k stars. It reached the front page of Hacker News, not once, but twice (maybe a little prematurely). Turns out the concept struck a chord with a lot of people.

With Joseph Jacks from OSS Capital leading our $2m funding round, we have an incredible array of angel investors participating alongside. AngelList Co-Founder Naval Ravikant, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, Shopify CEO Tobias L√ºtke, GitHub Co-Founder Tom Preston-Werner, Co-Creator of Apache Kafka Neha Narkhede, Head of Edge Infrastructure at Equinix Zachary Smith, CEO of Alluxio Haoyuan Li (who wrote the paper on the Virtual Distributed File System in which Spacedrive is loosely based), BloomTech CEO Austen Allred, former VP of Sales at Elasticsearch Justin Hoffman, former VMware COO Sanjay Poonen, Cal.com CEO Peer Richelsen and more.

With some of the greatest minds in technology backing us and a large community passionate for our vision we're positioned to make a sizable impact on the way we handle our most valuable personal data.
